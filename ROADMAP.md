# Replay — Enhancement Roadmap

Improvement plan for the Replay match video platform, organized as sequential milestones.

> This document supersedes `docs/copilot_roadmap.md`, which has been removed.

---

## Code Review Summary

The codebase is a well-structured single-file FastAPI backend (`server.py`, 1768 lines) with a no-build-step vanilla JS SPA (`script.js`, ~2600 lines). Core functionality — chunked uploads, GPU/CPU transcoding, HLS streaming, Cast/AirPlay — is solid. The milestones below represent the highest-impact improvements in recommended execution order.

---

## Milestone 1 — Safety Net ✅ COMPLETE

**Goal:** close security gaps and add test coverage so the rest of the roadmap can ship safely.

### Security

**1.1 Rate-limit login endpoint** ✅
Per-IP rate limiting: 5 attempts per 60-second window, returns HTTP 429. Stale IP entries are garbage-collected during token sweeps.

**1.2 Token cleanup on accumulation** ✅
`_sweep_expired_tokens()` runs from `_require_auth()` every 60 seconds, bulk-removing expired tokens. Token cap of 100 enforced at login; oldest evicted when cap is reached.

**1.3 Input validation on match updates** ✅
Pydantic models (`models.py`) enforce type constraints, string length limits, enum values for `format`, and regex patterns for `date` (YYYY-MM-DD) and `time` (HH:MM). `UpdateMatchRequest` uses `extra="forbid"` to reject unknown fields.

**1.4 CSRF / Origin validation** ✅
Optional `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` env var (comma-separated hostnames). When set, the login endpoint validates the `Origin` header. Bearer-token auth on all other mutating endpoints already prevents CSRF.

**1.5 Disk space check before transcoding** ✅
`_transcode_video()` checks free disk space before starting ffmpeg. On insufficient space, sets video status to `"error"` and logs the issue instead of starting a doomed transcode.

### Testing & CI

**1.6 Add test suite** ✅
37 tests across 4 files: `test_auth.py` (login, rate limit, token lifecycle), `test_matches.py` (CRUD, validation), `test_uploads.py` (session lifecycle), `test_settings.py` (settings CRUD). Uses `tmp_path` fixtures for isolation.

**1.7 Add CI workflow** ✅
GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`): compile check for `server.py`, `media.py`, `models.py` + `pytest tests/ -v` on push/PR to `main`.

**1.8 Add request/response models (Pydantic)** ✅
`models.py` contains `LoginRequest`, `CreateMatchRequest`, `UpdateMatchRequest`, `CreateUploadSessionRequest`. Wired into `server.py` endpoints; FastAPI auto-returns 422 for validation failures.

### Exit criteria — all met

- ✅ Login brute-force is throttled
- ✅ Core routes have automated test coverage (37 tests)
- ✅ CI passes on clean checkout
- ✅ Invalid payloads fail predictably (Pydantic 422 responses)

---

## Milestone 2 — Performance & Backend Structure ✅ COMPLETE

**Goal:** fix performance issues in hot paths and make `server.py` easier to change.

### Performance

**2.1 Reduce redundant DB reads in hot paths** ✅
Streaming endpoints (`stream_video`, `download_video`, `stream_hls_master`) use `_get_match_by_id()` — a single-row `SELECT * FROM matches WHERE id = ?` — instead of loading all matches.

**2.2 Connection pooling for SQLite** ✅
Thread-local cached connections via `db.connect()`. Each thread reuses its connection across calls; connections are validated before reuse and recreated if stale.

**2.3 Replace threading.Lock with asyncio.Lock** ✅
`MATCHES_LOCK` is now `asyncio.Lock()`. All callers that hold it are async, preventing event-loop blocking during write operations.

**2.4 HLS variant generation parallelism** ✅
`build_hls_assets` in `media.py` now runs all variant ffmpeg processes concurrently via `asyncio.gather()`, cutting HLS generation time to ~1/N for N variants.

**2.5 Startup backfill priority management** ✅
`backfill_hls_for_existing_videos` now takes a configurable startup delay (default 5s) and an inter-item delay (default 1s) so new uploads get priority on the transcode semaphore.

### Backend modularization

**2.6 Extract media pipeline to separate module** ✅
Already extracted to `media.py` (~345 lines): probing, transcoding (GPU/CPU fallback), HLS variant generation, and backfill logic.

**2.7 Extract service modules** ✅
`server.py` reduced from ~1800 to ~1150 lines. Extracted modules:

- `db.py` (327 lines): connection pool, migrations, match CRUD helpers
- `auth.py` (109 lines): token management, rate limiting, origin validation
- `settings.py` (151 lines): app settings persistence, rendering helpers
- `uploads.py` (128 lines): upload session lifecycle

**2.8 Structured logging** ✅
`log.py` provides a `JSONFormatter` emitting one JSON object per log line. Controlled via `LOG_FORMAT` (json/text) and `LOG_LEVEL` env vars. All modules use `log.setup("replay")`.

**2.9 Database migration mechanism** ✅
`db.py` contains a versioned migration system (`_MIGRATIONS` list, `schema_version` table). Each migration function is applied once; version is tracked and committed.

### M2 exit criteria — all met

- ✅ Streaming endpoints no longer load all matches per request
- ✅ `server.py` is substantially smaller with logic in focused modules (1800 → 1150 lines)
- ✅ Schema changes go through versioned migrations

## Milestone 3 — UX & Frontend Structure

**Goal:** make the frontend easier to extend and improve the day-to-day user experience.

### Frontend modularization

**3.1 Split `script.js` into logical modules**
**File:** `script.js` (~2600 lines)
The entire frontend is a single file with functions in a flat namespace. Split into modules (e.g. API client, player, uploads, season view, settings) loaded via `<script>` tags or lightweight ES modules — still no build step.

**3.2 Centralize UI feedback**
Consistent loading states, success/error banners, and clearer processing/retry messaging across all views.

### User experience

**3.3 Transcode progress reporting**
Currently the frontend polls match status and sees only `transcoding` or `ready`. There is no progress percentage. ffmpeg outputs frame progress to stderr — capture and expose it (e.g. via an SSE endpoint or a progress field on the match) so users see estimated completion.

**3.4 Match search and pagination**
**File:** `server.py:1163-1165`
`GET /api/matches` returns all matches with no pagination or filtering. As the match count grows, this becomes slow and wastes bandwidth. Add `?page=&limit=` query params and optional `?q=` text search across team names.

**3.5 Thumbnail generation**
Generate a thumbnail image (e.g. frame at 10% duration) during transcoding for each match. Display these on match cards in the season view instead of relying solely on team logos.

**3.6 Playback quality-of-life**
- Remember playback position
- Remember speed preference
- Keyboard shortcuts for common actions
- Next/previous match navigation

**3.7 Multi-user support**
The app currently supports a single admin account. For team use, consider adding:
- Read-only user accounts for players/parents
- Role-based access (admin vs. uploader vs. viewer)
- Per-match access control for private/public content

### Exit criteria
- Major frontend features are separated by responsibility
- Upload and playback failures are surfaced clearly
- Finding a past match is materially easier

## Milestone 4 — Media Hardening, Features & Ops

**Goal:** make the media pipeline recoverable, add advanced features, and harden for production.

### Media pipeline hardening

**4.1 Formalize processing state machine**
Define explicit states: created → uploading → uploaded → queued → processing → ready / failed. Persist failure reasons so admins can diagnose without inspecting files.

**4.2 Retry and recovery actions**
- Retry failed transcode from the UI or API
- Regenerate HLS for an existing MP4
- Clean orphaned partial uploads
- Verify asset integrity per match

**4.3 Expand admin diagnostics**
Surface active jobs, stale sessions, failed items, missing HLS assets, and disk usage summaries in the admin panel.

### Feature enhancements

**4.4 Video clipping / highlights**
Allow admins to mark time ranges within a match video as "highlights" or "clips." Generate sub-clips on the backend and display them alongside the full match.

**4.5 Match tagging and categories**
Add tags/categories to matches (e.g. "Tournament," "League," "Friendly") with filtering in the season view. This extends the existing Home/Away filter system.

**4.6 Bulk operations**
Support bulk delete, bulk re-transcode, and bulk HLS backfill from the admin panel. Currently these must be done one match at a time.

**4.7 Webhook / notification support**
Send a webhook or push notification when a transcode completes. Useful for automated workflows or alerting admins that a video is ready for review.

**4.8 S3 / object storage backend**
Replace filesystem storage with an optional S3-compatible backend for deployments where local disk is limited or where CDN integration is desired. The current `VIDEOS_DIR` abstraction makes this a moderate-effort change.

### Operational readiness

**4.9 Database backup and export**
Add an admin endpoint to export the SQLite database and match metadata as a downloadable archive. Useful for migration, disaster recovery, or switching to a different storage backend.

**4.10 Deployment documentation**
- CPU-only vs GPU deployment paths
- Upgrade/migration guide
- Troubleshooting guide for uploads/transcodes/HLS
- Backup and restore procedures

### Exit criteria
- Failed processing can be retried from the UI
- Media state is diagnosable without inspecting files manually
- Maintenance tasks are documented
